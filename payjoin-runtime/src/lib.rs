//! Sans-IO state machines for the payjoin v2 protocol.
//!
//! `payjoin_runtime` exposes a driver per role ([`ReceiverSession`],
//! [`SenderSession`]) that owns the multi-stage payjoin typestate, the OHTTP
//! polling cycle, and the `.save(&persister)` ceremony. The caller drives each
//! session by exchanging [`Request`] / response bytes with their preferred HTTP
//! transport and supplies wallet-aware decisions through the [`ReceiverWallet`]
//! / [`SenderWallet`] traits.
//!
//! The runtime is wallet-agnostic: it depends only on `payjoin`, `bitcoin`, and
//! `bitcoin-ohttp`. Bridge crates (e.g. `bdk_payjoin`) layer wallet ergonomics
//! on top.
//!
//! # Sketch
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut session = ReceiverSession::new(builder, relay, wallet, fee_range)?;
//! loop {
//!     match session.poll() {
//!         Step::SendRequest(req) => {
//!             let resp = http.post(req).await?;
//!             session.feed_response(resp.bytes().to_vec())?;
//!         }
//!         Step::Backoff => sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await,
//!         Step::Done => break,
//!         Step::Failed(e) => return Err(e.into()),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
